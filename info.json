  "description": "This mod provides a scenario that overhauls multiplayer spawning for option to play in Brave New World mode or Character mode, .\n[color=red][font=default-bold]You can play Brave New World and OARC separately.[/font][/color]\nThis mod merges both of those scenarios for an awesome single player / multiplayer game!\nEach player can decide to spawn with a character, full crafting\nand normal Factorio play mode, or to challenge themselves with a fast moving Brave New Player which requires a lazy bastard style of gameplay from God View. Read the in game FAQ if you are having troubles with how to get started in this scenario.",
