---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.64
    - crash control_script.lua 1313 attempt to concatenate field 'name'(a nil value)
    when a players roboport died - fixed - just restart your game with 4.2.64 and this will be fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.63
    - Mod supports allowing character and bno player on the same team. This is primed for what
      will become a path to supporting Factorio 2.0. A BNO player may be changed to character for 
      transport to another planet, and setup of that planet, then conversion back to BNO player.
    - further changes to anti-cheat code
    SeaBlock changes: 
    - Lots of changes to SeaBlock resulting in releases 4.2.56 through 4.2.63
    - Biters will be cleared following the Starting Area slider, but only the first of three rings, 
      they will be between 6 and 36 chunks if left 100%-600%. You can make them equal to what they 
      are in previous versions by setting starting area to 17%.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.62
    - continued bug fixes:
        1) Anti theft threw a report that an unknown entity was taken from a neutral force. I need
           to investigate this further - but patched.
        2) A log statement accessed a variable that was invalid immediately after a player restart
           fixed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.61
    - Bug fix when player joins a as character crash at 
      separate_spawns.lua:300: bad argument #1 of 2 to 'ipairs' (table expected, got nil)
      This was untested code giving character ability to research military for armor items
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.60
    - Bug fix when player joins a buddy team. Dumb log entry fail
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.59
    - Modified sprites for Ender Linked Chests to fix Normal Mode. 
    - Modified BNO Roboport and Assembling Machines sprites for Normal mode.
    - Overhaul how buddy spawn works. Your frieds can join later and no longer will be able to
      join your base. They can spawn their own base near yours. BNO supports upto 3 friends in 
      a square configuration. This is a seed for later use of PvP and PvE games.
      Open your team for players to join - they will NOT spawn inside your base. Try it !
    - Modified how SeaBlock worms spawn - BNO will now clear worms close to each spawn based on
      starting area size. This removes some of the challenge, so for previous configuration 
      set starting area size to 17%.
    - More robustness improvements
    - Exploding BNO Assemblers do not now degrade or explode while you are offline.
    - Pipe connection removed from BNO Assembler, until I fix the alignment issue
    - Ability for BNO player to mine in Krastorio2 fixed.
    - Character player in Space Block may now research military and make armor, and armor components
      which also means you no longer start with power-armor.
    - Tool help for BNO Assembler and Roboports
    - BNO Roboports now researchable and placeable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.58
    - Krastorio2: Disable iron pickaxe and advanced pickage for BNO Player, this increases the 
      mining options so that a bno player can mine - this is not allowed. Avail for character.
    - Fix for crash when new BNO Large Roboport is killed - Boom.  Fixed, copy this into your 
      current game and you'll get all these fixes
    - if player is not online the new bno assemblers will not take damage and explode if power
      drops below 20%.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.57
    - Protection added on clicking items for creation in BNO mode. BNO uses the prototype of the
      item you select to build, to load the players hand. Some craftable items in SeaBlock can not
      be loaded into your hand, and would cause a crash. Fixed.
    - SeaBlock: Changed the blueprint to include initial power setup - on water.
    - SeaBlock:Added 4 temperate trees near main on an island - this includes 400 wood 
    - SeaBlock:added 4 blue inserters and 4 filter inserters
    - SeaBlock: Moat choice removed
    - Buddy System Overhaul. Synchronization of the drop list, limit to 2 players in the menu
      at one time, support for independant moat settings for buddy spawns. Much more testing.
      Removal of Main Force from buddy system.
    - Limit of Main Force to be Brave New Players ONLY. This solves some complexity and confusion
      around use of the character checkbox.
    - Spawn defaults have changed - and more consistant with the most used options in this mod.
    - Movement outside Fog Of War shows a message and sound to inform you that you need a radar
      to move further outside your base.
    - Synchronization in buddy screen - when one player chooses character option it shows up on 
      the other players screen.
      When each player enters the buddy screen, the buddy list is updated and selects a player 
      making selection of buddies faster.
    - I renamed the prototype Roboport-main to Roboport-bno since you can now research
      these roboports for use in the game.
    - New Assembler with settable quantity to provide to players, and starting crafting speed 1-30x
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.56
    - bug fix on crash for SeaBlock
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.55
    - Kudos to Nomad, found a couple issues working with other mods.
      circuitissimo shows a black screen when in the mods circuit - fixed.  I do need to add an
      an option to allow hosts to define a list of entities that can be held in BNO players
      inventory - so items can be placed from within the circuit.
    - Added more support for circuitissimo, allowing player to hold combinators and poles.  Fixed
      a black screen when entering the special circuit from circuitsissimo.
    - A compatibility issue - crash - in FNEI. When menu is open and hit Q or fast transfer items
      a crash can occur. I modified the cheat detector to keep from crashing when any menu is opened.
    - Modified prerequisites for ender linked chests, to require research of red circuits before
      you can research ender linked chests.
    - fix to crash if miner notification is on
    - I made the main new roboport researchable and useable. I had to extend the construction zone
      to make it reachable via blueprint, without dropping an intermediate roboport.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.54
    - If you include "Scrap Resource" mod - you can choose between entities or ore. 
      I rebalanced the amounts since I used a 10X multiplier, which is now 1X, but then increased
      the size and quantity of the main scrap patch.
    - Increased the size of the Scrap Resource ore in main base, this patch qty has been modified.
    - Added a GUI option to mute the messages on every miner deconstruction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.53
    - Added host option for choice to enable/disable moat, and if moat bridge/no bridge
    - I moved the water strip from top of base, to left of the coal for those playing without moat.
    - Fix for crash when player CTRL Clicks a chest when the menu is opened.
    - More work on anti-griefing, reporting to other players that someone is suspected of cheating
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.52
    - Fixed bug that caused crash on restart of the first player, when no one was on Main Force
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.51
    - Pop up was added in .51 to inform you why you can't choose character or are forced to choose
      character for a specific team/force.  You must be the same type as the whole team. If someone
      chooses character for Main Force - and you choose to join main force, you must be character.
      The pop up attempts to make that clear. But I didn't properly dismiss the pop up.
    - Previously I would enumerate players to determine what that team was, but if a player
      restarted they would automatically be tossed onto Main Force. This could cause a mismatch if 
      a player restarted while another player joined - fixed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.50
    - Updated #slots from 10 to 20 in main roboport to allow placing 750 bots in the roboport.
      Thanks Pirion!
    - Fixed a rare bug where an admin accesses an admin moves something from a players inventory,
      /o player,  causes a crash trying to figure out if someone is stealing from other players.
    - rewrote some griefing and stealing protection code
    - gui pop up when someone chooses character and can't understand why it won't allow character,
      and vice-versa.  The team must be of the same type character or brave new player.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.49
    - Shout out to ZonkHonk who reported a crash when 250/500 was chose in the array of bot options.
      This was due to my inadvertently transposing of those numbers from 500/250 to 250/500.
    - updated main roboport to have 20 slots, since 500/250 bots will require 15 slots - thx ??????.
    - changed number of silo's to a drop list that offers place: anywhere, 6, 12, 24 silos.
    - on dangOreus with silo's ore was being placed on each silo. After the first person joins the
      game, this ore will be removed.
    - bug fix: introduced into 4.2.48 that turned off ore under the DangOreus ores.
    - specifically do not support Kux Smart Linked chests - desync's, doesn't support multiplayer, 
      assumes 0,0 is spawn so blue chests don't work. Removed from support.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.48
    - added ability for Enders Linked Chests to have logistic wires attached
    - removed the ore normally placed in main, but left the oil and cleared area around the oil
      to enable on site starter processing of oil to get plastic/red circuits/ boxes/roboports 
      without using precious main area.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.47
    DangOreus mod support:
        - Stopped DangOreus from populating nauvis surface with ore, this will reduce join lag
        - Added "tiny" to enable DangOreus players to spawn closer to 0,0 which will reduce the
          amount of ore in a players base. I recommend a richness of 17%.
        - Added support for Enders Linked Chests - and fixed that it doesn't allow non-admin players
          from setting the box address.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.46
    - In player menu - click on a name and their position will be printed to you. Click on the gps 
      position provided to see that player in map view.
    - Modified options for Scrap Resource mod - offering Ore Only and More Items.
    DangOreus mod support:
        - Modified starting area for DangOreus mod.
    Enders Linked Chests
        - Added ability for anyone to set the address of the chest - not just admins.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.45
    - There was a hard to find bug that caused a crash if in while running alien modules mod, and
      you wave your cursor over alien-ore, while you have a menu item open, it would cause a crash.
      This crash area was previously known, but not that it was caused when the menu is open. 
      The fix I applied with a message to send me your log file - had a typo - DOH !
      I more definitively debugged this and fix is good.
    - Auto Deconstruct miners are fixed and will ping the miner being removed.
    - I reworked the start area.
    - Some of my special players are white listed. Which means they can work from map view.
      Admins can add their own special players to whitelist-players.lua
      They are not admin in this file, it only allows modification of their base in map view.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.44
    - White list added to enable them to work in map mode.
    - removal of some excessive logging
    - no 100% fix for Auto Decon Miners yet. I recommend leaving them on until you drop uranium and 
      just deal with the occasional miner removed incorrectly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.43
    - Fixed Auto Deconstruct, and highlight the area where the miner was for 20 seconds
    - added support for scrap-resource and redefined the items provided from those resources
      give scrap resources by by RedRafe a try https://mods.factorio.com/mod/scrap-resource
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.42
    - bug fix crash on control.lua 845
    - Reconfigured /stats functionality, added button to server info tab in ui
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.40
    - /stats command hard coded - bits-orio adding game statistics, this currently hard coded for 
      iron and not yet integrated into the game menu tabs.  I like the pop up though.
      stats is work in progress - not fully integrated or completed.
    - on death - player that died used to hear 2 sounds, now 1 random, everyone else gets 1 too
    - anti-grief measure to draw attention to a player that is teleporting more than 10 chunks away
      into a vehicle,and taking items from chests - EVERYONE but that player is notified of this with gps ping.
    - Since Space Block provided inventory items and BNO did as well, and I only clear on death or 
      restart, everyone that didn't hit the restart button got double resources.  FIXED !
    - One more sound added - only heard when someone does something bad. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.39
    - Fix for a bug I put in 4.2.38 which caused a crash on every rocket launch
    - Removal of corpses now linked to backspace key.  This taken directly from 'Remove Biter Corpses'
      mod. I would have instead included that mod, but it spams everyone that corpses are removed
      when anyone does it. Most mods still think this is a single team game.
    - Chat color and sound change - thx bits-orio for a new sound
    - Individual team players will be notified of only their research item completed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.38
    - Sound for chat is now more noticeable, but hopefully not irratating.
    - Auto Deconstruction of miners.  Host can turn this option OFF, if they decide to load a different mod.
      Players can turn this off/on if the host has enabled it. See Server Info menu.
    - Reduced lead ore in maps using bzlead mod from 17 million, which was a bit crazy large amount
    - Fixed the multitude of jail spawn players, that couldn't move at that small jail site
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.37
    - There was a scenario where spawning character players would get 2X resources - fixed

  Minor Bug Fix's:
    - Fix to Offline Protect checkbox not staying checked
    - Some of the other checkbox's in Server Info did not toggle properly, fixed
    - Changes to when sound it played - each player will hear the "you lose" sound, the loser will hear
      one of two random lose sounds and the "you lose" sound. But more importantly this is done after 
      the player is removed from the game, sent to 0,0.  This caused a race condition that in one case
      resulted in a crash - fixed.
    - Modified start items for character - was supposed to get 2/2/2/2 logistic chests with 4 yellow, 
      was getting an extra blue chest - removed.
    - Initial jailing of players at 0,0 showed many players waiting to spawn, some unable to move - this is fixed
None of above impact game play, and is intended to move towards a stable release with no bugs

  Not Fixed Bug:
   There is still a bug that occur when one player trys to join a team 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.36
- Made the slider in the single/multiplayer game to generate a map for hosting, work in game for RICHNESS.
Results:  17% - 600%
   Iron:    90K - 3.2MB   - 100% is 541K
   Copper:	72K - 2.5 MB  - 100% is 433K
   Stone:   57K - 2 MB    - 100% is 346K
   Coal:    57K - 2 MB    - 100% is 346K
   These are independently settable in the Factorio UI to configure a game.
    - If Space Block is running removed : electric-mining-drill, burner-mining-drill, light-armor from research
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.35
    - Fix bug in SpaceBlock where I made resources around the player.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.34
    - Distant Rocket Silo removed - this should save on memory and be a bit easier to play.
      Players can build rocket silo anywhere.
    - Additional sounds added - for lose scenario
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.33
    - Changed warning sound to be different and more subtle when biters are attacking
    - Added option to enable player to turn on/off attacks by biters while offline. The default is 
      set in the config.lua - ENABLE_OFFLINE_PROTECTION - defaulting to true.
    - protection against a crash caused when two players in buddy mode joined as BNO + Character. The UI
      attempts to make this impossible, but obviously one got through.
    - Character player gets 4/4/4/4 logistic chests of R/G/B/P
    - Fixed disabling of Steel-axe. This was stated as disabled in 4.2.31 - fixed here.
    - Modified starting items for BNO Player on Space Block - adding logistic chests.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.32
    - Bug fix in code that clears inventory - only shows up in multiplayer mode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.31
    - updated list of supported mods to limit to Alien Modules (1.4.2) mod that I recently modified to 
      support teams.
    - After death of a players main roboport - terminating his game, the items in the players inventory are removed.
      This is more meaningful to character players and removes a potential cheat.
    - Removed requirement to launch before getting level 3 modules.
    - Removed recipe for Steel Axe for BNO players. This screws up the ability for you to pick up buildings 
      or mine - from outter space.
    - Added support for LootChestPlus mod - to collect items on the ground, ideal for use with Alien-Modules.
    - Krastorio Character player gets 2 addition red/blue chests - same as BNO player.
    - Removed the dependancy on launching a rocket to make speed 3 modules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.30
    - Removed Restart button for players in spawn location
    - Minor Fix: player menu, which was not showing character/brave new player correctly
    - Added items for SeaBlock for both character and BNO player
    - Added option chooseable by host to modify starting chests from 4 upto 10 total red/blue chests for BNO player
      no change to green/purple chests.  This to help remove starting grind.
    - SeaBlock and Krastorio text on ground at spawn if those mods are loaded
    - Fixed bug on exit that could occasionally cause a crash when a player left the game
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.29 Feb 12, 2024
    - Fixed Buddy Spawn mode - this previous caused a crash
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.28 Feb 5, 2024
    - Labelled on ground Sea Block, Krastorio2 when you join with those mods running
    
      Bug fixes 
    - One due to someone exiting the game.
    - Other bug was the labelling of Character/Brave New Player in player list was wrong
    - SeaBlock - addition of 300 wood pellets and 2 assemblers to Brave New Player - otherwise could be deadlock getting to wood stage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.27 Jan 29, 2024
    - Added support for SeaBlock in both character and BNO modes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.26 Jan 23, 2024
    - bug fix of crash when player leaves game - typically crash is due to player losing their main roboport 
    to the biters. If you want to fix your SAVE file - unzip it, Replace the oarc_global.cfg, and control.lua files, 
    zip it back up - and use that to restart your game.
    - Fixed Krastorio2 creep ! So removed the free bio labs and free research of bio mass
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.25 Jan 18, 2024
Modified BNO to support character and BNO mode for Krastorio2.  Each player has the choice.
  Bug Fixes:
    - Previous versions would increase the richness of the patches 4X every time a new player joined.
      The normal coal patch is around 1.3 million, so that quickly would grow to 4.2.26
    
    - Previous version fixed the crash when a player joined/exit, which was due to my insistance of 
      stamping every base with the name of the player. This feature makes it much easier for hosts
      to maintain a map. Although now with the ability to hide your base, the host may need to go
      into editor mode to see other bases.  But I left TTL on - which would make it disappear after 10
      seconds - this is fixed.
    - Rebalanced the items provided in each mode: BNO, Krastorio2, Space Block for Character & Brave New Player 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.24 Jan 14, 2024
    - Bug Fixes - still working on a crash in Space Block on entry or exit of game
      please report if you see issues preferrably in my discord: https://discord.gg/AeFhytZKXk
      or with a slower response in the mod repository
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.23
    - Bug Fixes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.22
- Feature - Added support for SpaceBlock in Character mode
- bug fix - all minor bugs that do not impact gameplay
  - list of players was not showing the proper character/brave new player mode
  - When a player goes offline, I draw his name in the base, to aid me to see where players are
    and rarely remove them if they stayed for 15 minutes, but quit and never came back.
    When I restarted this player, the name of the player remained on the ground, even thought
    everything else was removed. Now I remove that text.  
  - CharacterMode checkbox was not set properly after a RESTART
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.21
- bug fixes
	- mostly crash on a second player joining due to an uninitialized array
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.20
- completion of as much multiplayer testing as I was able to do with the Character checkbox gui.
  Time for release. See the 4.19 releases for items that have changed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.192
Date: 1/1/2023 
- No release of 4.2.19.. this was temporarily released and removed once bugs were found in multiplayer testing.
- Bug fixes around character / Brave New Player mode.  The issue was that a force/team has to all 
  be the same type, since there are some settings for each mode that are forced based.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.191
Date: 12/31/2023 -  Happy New Year !
- Added a value in game settings to increase the logistics range. I highly recommend a maximum value of 32 for a normal BNO game, and 64 for a Krastorio2 game.
  Krastorio base is 32 tiles larger.
- Added ability to pick up -fuel.  This enables loading of solid-fuel, rocket-fuel, nuclear-fuel into vehicles like lex-aircraft.
  This also enables you to fly a craft like a lex-aircraft that has logistics to a remote location, carry a power source, setup a remote base, without cascading
  roboports to that location. This will be useful later when we offer a teleport feature to remote bases, and silo's.
- Added support for both Character mode and non-character mode. Spawning as a character will be normal Factorio mode, with crafting, inventory, but with fewer items
  and with 1/5 the number of bots that the non-character BNO mode player gets.
- Fixed the stickiness of the team and moat settings at the start of the game. Choose restart - will show your original choices without making you reselect them.
- Added checkbox in System Info menu to disable sharing your map view, this is both a privacy and a anti griefing feature
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.18
Date: 12/19/2023 -  Merry Christmas !
  Changes:
Modified settings for Krastorio
- support square and diamond bases - Thx JVM !
- fixed Restart for Krastorio2
- moved resource patches for Krastorio2
- increased richness of in base - iron, coal, stone, copper for K2, reduced rare-metals 
- Fixed some of the items provided - rifle-ammo, and drills for K2.
- increased main roboport construction zone by 2 tiles, to enable access to the trees that go around a square base
- Previously starting area less than 50% could cause biter bases to spawn inside your base, fixed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 4.2.17
Date: 12/3/2023 
  Changes to support Freight Forward
-Added titanium if bztitanium mod loaded
-Added lead if bzlead mod loaded
-removed all silo's if Freight Forwading loaded

  Changes to support Krastorio 2
-Move bot speed to keep Krastorio from over riding with slower bots
-Enabled picking up any "fuel-cell" and "dt-cell"
-Provide Rifle Ammo - instead of pistol ammo
-Gave each player 2 kr-bio-lab
-Make base larger
-Doubled the in base resource richness
-Add rare metal to base
-Space Matter text at spawn location (0,0) for space block only
-Removal of restart in K2 only
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/20/2023 - 4.2.16 Happy Thanksgiving !
bug found in previous versions that removed resources in main spawn if not playing with Space Block.
This bug removed all main resources.
Space Block changes:
- Added 2 labs to chests to remove some initial grind.
- Added another Q&A regarding Fog of War.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/31/2023 - 4.2.15 Happy Halloween !
- Some changes to Space Block. Easy Start and Normal start are identical in the items they provide. 
  The difference, is Easy Start has a layout to teach the player how to play Space Port. The ONLY
  advantage is that if the host chooses not to provide a boiler/steam engine setup, EasyStart turns 
  that on.
- Larger Info screen, shown at start and in top left info screen. This answers the most asked 
  questions.
- 3 tiles wider to support the broader setup. I stretched the substation to it's proper distance
  covering more area, added more capacitors, it looks like 2.5MW and 100 MJ storage. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/26/2023 - 4.2.14
- Added more text on ground. Some in both easy/normal modes, more in easy mode.
- You can always choose one mode - look at box contents, and restart - flipping back and forth to decide which mode you want.
- Turned off constant reporting of missile launch of OTHER forces, each force that launch's will see the message that they launched - but nothing other than first launch of other teams.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/24/2023 - 4.2.13
- Fix bug that crashes with:  
	"brave-new-oarc/data.lua:29: attempt to concatenate global 'energyBotsMovement' (a nil value)"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/23/2023 - 4.2.12

Main roboport is named after the primary player.

Player Name in base bothered some players, so it is removed shortly after creating your base, but restored while you are offline.
This enables tracking of bases.  Also previous versions would not remove this name and it could be littered all around the map if
a player restarted multiple times. Fixed!

Modified Map Generation code to take Starting Area Size into account when building the map. So 
Deathworld will be quite a bit more difficult.

Map generation code changes to use the "Starting Area Size" setting in the Map creation to impact the 
distance the biters are from your main base. Deathworld is not really deathworld in Oarc based on this 
algorithm.  This is pretty awesome code, and made to look simple. Great code always looks simple.

The map generation code modifies Factorios map settings to make each base playable and not completely 
overrun with biter bases. It sets up three zone.
Starting area is 6 chunks - a chunk is 32 tiles (turn on the grid in F4 to see this) - no nests in this area.
Next zone is starts outside 6 and goes to 12 chunks
Final area - Danger Zone - starts at 24, previously it was 30 and in Oarc is normally 32. I did testing 
to see what is appropriate and 24 is right.

When you play DeathWorld (75%) - this tightens up from 6,12,24 chunks to 4.5, 9 and 18.
If you want the old 30 tiles - set the Starting area to 125%.

The map generation modifies the biter nests so that in the second zone 5% of the nests are kept, and only small nests will be in this area.
In the Danger zone, 20% of the nests are kept and only small and medium nests remain.
Check my extensive list of screen shots in my discord to see what this looks like in a deathworld and normal game at 75%.
Just for fun - give 17% Starting area size - you'll have biters in your main area!

Bug fix - a new player could crash a server.  Talk about random - moving your character after the first
person joins could crash the server. Thanks to SilverSname for working with me on this one.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6/24/2023 - 4.2.07
bug fixes due to large maps running into issues with spawning players into unsafe areas - fixed.
bug fix - occasionally spawning a player would cause them to crash the game - fixed.
added the number of biters in attack swarm
fixed transport drones exploding
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5/09/2023 - 4.2.06
Added a setting for the world size, Small, Normal, Large. Small is half of normal, Large is double of Normal.
Increased the max number of silos to 24.
Modified the drop down for restart for admins to prompt with their name for when they quickly want to respawn.
Moved the water slot for no moat spawns to top left - on the edge of the tree line.
Removed duplicate swarm pings.
Performance enhancement to not check swarms every tick, perform once per second only when there are swarms incoming
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5/04/2023 - 4.2.05
Bug Fix
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5/02/2023 - 4.2.04
Moved Buddy spawn 2.5 chunksize further apart. previously they were 5 chunksize, so now 7.5.
The buddy spawn was overlapping logistics areas, which is ok if you want the other player to control
your bots in that area. But it should be further apart.

Bug Fixes:
Fixed on first launch the game would crash.
Fixed where the swam notification could crash due to some state the swarm is in that is not fully identified in the group entity.
Fixed where a drop occurs on some unknown surface - this one has me stumped, but it won't break now. You'll see a notification
to only the player that the bug was initiated from to tell me to look at logs. I should probably broadcast it, but I'll be 
monitoring all logs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4/30/2023 - 4.2.03
Added an option to enable a swarm to be tagged via a ping/gps statement for each player. Clicking the ping
follows the biter swarm approaching the base. Clicking that ping after the swarm is dead will show where they 
grouped for the attack - which is useful to know where they came from.
Turning on/off this option default is settable by the host, but currently it is settable by each player
within the game via the top left settings and is a per-player setting.
Each player will only see their pings, showing incoming swarms, and only active swarms that are moving towards your base.
I haven't tested this in buddy mode, but buddies should see swarms intended for your/their bases.

Hopefully - finally fixed the Silo not being able to be researched bug.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4/24/2023 - 4.2.02
-bug introduced into 4.2.01 - I locked the recipe and technology for productivity-module-3 behind a rocket launch. Well you
 couldn't research a silo without proctivity-module-3's !  Fixed
-added ability for each player to restart themselves at any time - no warning that they are going to lose their base - yet, be careful
 I'll put a limit to the number of restarts. Note the 15 minute timer starts from the time you initially start, so 15 minutes of restarts and you may be stuck with the last base
 I will try to warn you with the number of restarts you have left - for now there is no limit
-moved the pump for easy start where you get a free boiler and two pumps, and chest to not run out of power too early. 
 The pump was close to walls and could mistakenly be removed by removing the walls.
-admins can remove offline players
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4/10/2023 - 4.2.01
Fixed collision box of Main Mega Roboport - so you can place items directly next to it
Removed excessive logging, which should improve performance
Changed spacing of in base oil deposits so that one storage tank will fit between two dericks with no space
Moat water is 8 tiles, increased to 12. The spitter range is 15, at an angle this may keep spitters from attacking items(pumps),
in the base. This normally occurs when there is a moat bridge.

I noticed power on the Mega Roboport - can drop to zero very rapidly when alot of bots are charging. Quadrupling:
input flow limit, buffer capacity & energy_usage. The MegaRoboport is fully charged at the start of the game, a normal roboport
Since your bots will fly to your team mates base to charge - if your power goes to zero, I added a boiler and steam engine, as an option
pickable at start of the map, by the map host. This will power bots all night and is removeable. BUT if you remove the water pump - you can not place it 
again - it is a waterless waterpump.

Increased bot storage from 8 slots to 10 in the Mega Roboport.
Leaving player name in their base after the Welcome disappears.
Made it configurable by the game host to enable the player to choose whether there is a moat bridge, or to make them play via the choice of the host.
I add three dots of oil at a random location outside of main base. It is spawned with a random amount of richness. I have increased the minimum richness.
Slightly risky here - I tested but didn't take the time for a full test - I added auto removal of miners after they deplete the resource.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2/1/2023 - 4.2.00
Bug fixes - some also pushed back into Oarc and BNW.
Deletion of Vehicles spider/tank/jeep outside of pollution zone fixed
Crash in dropItems fixed
Crash on launch of rocket - fixed
Less logging - save on lag
Regrowth works - leave it ON in the default config.lua file, no other regrowth mods needed
Added option for 250/500 of logistic/construction bots at the start of a map
Moved Speed Module 3 and Production Module 3 into locked entities, awaiting a missile launch. 
I was told it was confusing to see that a L3 module was available, but was not selectable, one user thought this was a bug. 
Now it will unlock and you'll have to research to obtain these modules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/26/2023 4.1.9
Modifying graphics - so the main roboport looks different and is larger.
Expanded main roboport to have 16 charge slots.
Logistics network and construction radius doubled.
Icon fixed, removing confusion over duplicate Roboport icons.
Previously selecting the "other" roboport icon that looked the same placed a roboport, 
but if you used this icon for logistics it didn't limit roboports, because it 
was actually roboport-main.  Main area changed again. This is now visible as an icon if 
for example you selected it from the group of entities in the game for the toolbar. 
But you can not place it or copy it.
Main Roboport has 16 robots charging at no extra cost other than the spike that occurs when 16 bots charge.

I've decided that not locking Spidertron until a missile is launched is going to add to more fun. You NEED a spidertron to setup remote bases, disconnected from your main base. 
You may need a spidertron if you don't want to kreep roboports to the silo. You can bring construction bots, deploy and setup a train line without a logistics line using Spidertron.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/21/2023 - 4.1.8
Bug fix. This only impacted game play if you wanted to see the contents of the yellow logistic storage chests at center, or if you deleted them. There is actually an invisible chest over the normal chest there. This is the only fix for 4.1.8

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/19/2023 - 4.1.7
Well I broke the bots. Their power consumption was way too high because I reversed their energy use per tick and their energy use per move. Hell the bots were coming out of the roboport to recharge. 
Glad none had heart attacks. FIXED !

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/19/2023 - 4.1.6
Modified starting area, upgraded starting power from 50Mj to 90Mj and power from 720kW to 1.4MW, Fully charged. Also placed a blue chest with requests for robots.
The bots will go into chests if you move the roboports.

No more special bots. The problem was that when you choose "fast bots" and you finally get to making bots, you're disappointed at how slow they are. They become a major negative
towards fun game play.

We now have a end game scenario - previously if one person's main roboport died, every one died.  The changes: Biters HATE your main roboport and if they get near it, 
they will aggressively attack it, but they are passive to all other roboports.
If the main one dies, you immediately get thrown back to 0,0 location and are able to restart, rejoin a force. No one else is impacted.

Fixed RESTART player so the menu comes up once they go back to 0,0.

Many settings added to the "Mod settings" screen:
	- number of Silo's' - 1..12
	- Bots energy use, normal, increase energy storage, increase range, increase movement, increase all
		Bots consume energy, Fast bots consume more energy. Energy is VERY important in this scenario.
		Increase storage, increases their max storage from 1.5MJ to 3MJ
		Increase range, decreases their consumption per tick
		Increase movement, decreases their consumption while moving
	- Number of starting bots added to your mod settings - you choices: 10/5, 50/25, 100/50, 200/100 for construction/logistic bots
	  The max bots in starter roboport are 350, so I think these are good options.  If you choose 10/5 I recommend also clicking on the resistance values to make them "nearly" indestructible.
	- Bot speed in km/h.  10-400.  Note that the default game starts at 12.9 km/h. So choose 13 if you want to go close to default. Increases in research will speed them up further.
	- Bridge moat - if you have a moat, do you want biters to access your players?
	- anti-grief. This basically turns off the ability for someone to delete anything in your base via map view.
	- TTL for ghost images - default is 30 minutes, options, 10, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 or use config.lua to define
	- Item and Energy Sharing - chests and accumulators that enable you to share items and power with EVERYONE.
	- Base shape - Circle or Octagon
	- Resistances to make you bots near indestructible !

Verified - buddy spawn to kick all players associated with that base

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/15/2023 - 4.1.5
Welcome message disappears but player name remains
Oil patch slight move to enable roboport to fit between it.
Fixed reset player - but player has to be offline for it to work properly
Previously if one player lost their starting roboport it ended the game. Now it will display that
you lost but enables you to continue playing.  I may change this to immediately remove and clean up 
player that died and not hastle other players with the lose message.
Options settable by host:
	added moat bridge option in gui MOD interface
	added four different resistances in MOD interface for fire, spitter, explosion and physical damage to bots
	added support for turning anti-griefing on/off. This disables delete in map view and sets a time limit on ghost items.
	moved oil to make room for roboport between it
	offer chest sharing and energy share
	Number of silos

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/8/2023 - 4.1.4
More work finding bots that explode, removed excessive logging. Fixed exploding bots.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/7/2023 - 4.1.3
12/27/2022
Modified the start state to be 1x multiplier for research. Most people will just play scenario from the mod, not start a server, use the technology_price_multiplier in map-settings.json if running from a server.
I may not have upgraded the github before posting to factorio mod site, so this is updated, in both location.

12/29/2022
Increased richness of three oil spots outside main, with randomness on how rich

1/05/2023
Modified bots so they are indestructible. This needs some work since I don't mind if they die,
I just don't want them randomly exploding because you are working them too hard. 
Slowing them down to a crawl and letting them die to biters if misused is fine,
but just exploding for some unknown cause is bull.

1/07/2023 - Anti-grief turned on by default (config.lua)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/26/2022 4.1.2
Fixed issue with moving player on reset and second player not being moved to new location on start
Fixed issue where sometimes the base was not cleaned up when a player is reset of leaves

Adding - closer/further biters - based on Starting Area Size
Adding - a text message on ground to tell player to get power
